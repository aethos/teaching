Write a tester for your class.


####Leap Year:
Write a class to test if a year is a leap year. Accept a year as input and follow this logic:

> Leap years are years that are divisible by 4 and not by 100. 
> But, if a year is also divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.

Come up with a set of test cases for this input.
As a bonus, prevent the user from entering years less than 0.
