####P5.7 (Big Java 5th ed):
French country names are feminine when they end with the letter e, masculine otherwise, except for the following which are masculine even though they end with e:
- le Belize
- le Cambodge
- le Mexique
- le Mozambique
- le Za√Øre
- le Zimbabwe

Write a program that reads the French name of a country and adds the article le for masculine, or la for feminine, such as le Cananda or la Belquie.
However, if the country name starts with a vowel, use l'; for example, l' Afghanistan.
For the following plural country names, use les:
- les Etas-Unis
- les Pays-bas


####Scope:
- Concept: <em>Where is each variable valid?<em>
- What is an instance variable?
- What is a function parameter?
- Follow the {}!


####Math.random:
Use Math.random to get the following four values
- A double between 0.0 and 1.0
- A double between 0.0 and 10.0
- An int between 3 and 8
- An int between -10 and 10


####Musicians Group:
Create a class that takes a number of musicians, and has a method to return the group noun for that number. The group nouns are:
- Solo (1)
- Duet (2)
- Triplet (3)
- Quartet (4)
- Quintet (5)
- Sextet (6)
- Septet (7)
- Octet (8)
- Nonet (9)


####Boolean Example
- Write a truth table for the expression
	(a && b) || (!b && c)
