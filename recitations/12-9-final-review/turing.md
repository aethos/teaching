## Turing Machines

### General:

	What are the parts of a Turing Machine?

	What actions can a Turing Machine take?

	What is the Church-Turing thesis?

	What did you think of The Imiatation Game?


###R12.19:

	Write a turing machine that operates on any string of 1s and changes it to a string of alternating 1s and 0s.
	eg.

	1		-->		1
	11		-->		10
	111 	--> 	101
	1111 	-->		1010

	Draw a state diagram for this turing machine and write an instruction set. Test it!

###R12.23:
	
	Write a turing machine that operates on the unary representaiton of any number and decides whether the number is 0; your machine should produce an output tape containing the unary represenation of 1 if the number was 0 and the unary representation of 2 if the number was not 0.
	eg.

	1		-->		11
	111		-->		111

	note: unary represenation of 0 is "1".
